% Figure shows a resistor and capacitor in series and a shunt inductor,
% that is a second-order HPF.
% There is no load current in the circuit. Thus, the current in the
% inductor and capacitor is the same size.

%% Calculate a state-space model for the circuit with v1 as input and v2 and vc as output.
% Why is the D matrix not zero?



%% Transform the state-space model into a transfer function (in s-domain) with v1 as input and v2 as output.



%% Derive the transfer function directly through voltage division and compare.
